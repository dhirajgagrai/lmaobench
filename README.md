# lmaobench

lmaobench is a microbenchmarking tool loosely based on the [lmbench paper](https://lmbench.sourceforge.net/lmbench-usenix.pdf).  
It measures things like system call latency, memory access time, context switches and more â€” probably incorrectly, but fast.

Useful if you enjoy watching stats and numbers go brrr and pretending it means something.
